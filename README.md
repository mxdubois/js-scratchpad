1. `npm run test:watch` to run Jest in watch-mode
2. `npm inspect` to launch an inspector on Jest
    * Then go to `chrome://inspect` to connect to the inspect session

Also setup with a prettier and eslint config that I have running on save from SublimeText but you can hookup to your editor of choice.
